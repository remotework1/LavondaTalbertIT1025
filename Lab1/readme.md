### Executive Summary

#### The purpose of IT1025 class is to teach, explain and help students comprehend the teachings of the programming industry. In this class students will learn technical terms and the use of GitHub as a programming application. There is also technical terms to understand both networking and the technology industry.

### Information System Components

#### I enjoy the use of the self-checkout at the local grocery stores. Now mind you every store doesn't partake in that type of service. It is an automated process that grocery stores allow the customer to interact with computer user interface instead of the store's employee. The data is determine by the product's barcode, weight and price. The customer scans the product and automated voice replies with the information and asks that the product is placed on a conveyor belt to travel at the end of the lane for bagging. 

### GitHub

##### Client-Server Architecture

#### On the client side the action takes place on the user's computer. On the server side all action takes place on the web server. GitHub Desktop is a fast and easy way to contribute to coding projects from Windows and allow the public to view and interact. 

##### Cloud Computing

#### The use of my GMail account and working on the numerous software packages daily is an example of Cloud Computing. Not only a convenience but a major price reduction. I use to update software packages all of the time with the ordering of disks and large instruction booklets. Seeing how technology has ease the burden of increasing my footprint on this earth by putting both hardware and software in the Cloud has incredible.
