### Executive Summary

#### In this class students will learn the components of the hard drive and its performance. Techincal terms and its place in history and today's advancement on its advancement in future technology. 

### a. Hardware
##### Hard Drives and Memory

##### ALU and the Control Unit

#### ALU loads data to an input register (that holds numbers temporarily) while it waits for the CPU to send a couple of wires to retrieve the data. The CPU sends instructions to the ALU oh=n how to perform and the ALU sends the results.

##### CPU, Input & Output

#### The example using the letter 'B' was a simple way of describing input to output. Lets start with input. When you type the letter L (for Lavonda) it turns the information to binary data (1 and 0). This is the language our computer reads and decipher data. Then the CPU calculates on how to display it using pixels. This is also how images (vector) is processed. The CPU relies on memory to dictate how this letter L should look. Then it is sent to screen (output) in binary and is converted into the tiny lights in color that we see as the letter L.

##### Logic Gates and Circuits

#### A truth table lists organize information in every possible scenario. It helps in the validity of arguments. Where a NAND gate all outputs are false if all inputs are true.

##### IEEE

#### It is an technical association that works with advancing innovation and technology for people's benefit. Its ethical belief comes from making sure developers of AI know human needs aren't the mainstay of its practices. That holding values and principles are how they affect the community at large. 

### Data Representation

##### Numeric Conversions

#### Binary (base-two)is written as 0 (off) and 1 (on). It is the language that computer uses. Decimal is base-ten. It is the counting system we use everyday. Hexadecimal (base-sixteen) which is represented in deciding color palette used in web design. Those in the graphic design industry uses this in their design work.

##### Hexadecimal Color Representation

#### The #ff016b is the RGB representation of color used on the web. When working in print, CMYk value is used because there has to be a true version of the color black.

#### This color could be problematic in the sense for those who have eye impairments. The color used should have contrast between the type and the background.

### Conclusion

#### This segment has allowed students to understand the difference between the numbering system used throughout the world ahd how its applied. A better understanding of the components used in the computer hard drives and how it relates to data. What the users need to know to access information more rapidly and at a better cost value.
