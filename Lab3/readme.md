### Executive Summary

##### In this chapter students will learn about Virtualization and Python. Explore careers in Information Technology through the use of co-ops, internships, certificates, certifications, industry associations and student organization memberships.

### Software

##### Application software's role is to help the user create and accomplish a task. There are what people considered the 'Killer App' it was a spreadsheet and people were buying computers just to run it. The spreadsheet that business worldwide rely on today is Microsoft Excel. There's also the productivity software that became a necessity in the business workplace. Microsoft Office, Google and many others have permeated the workplace with software that has a footprint in word processing, spreadsheets, presentation and email. Utility software is one of the subcategories of application software. It helps modify or repair your computer. When you buy a computer, the company always install some form of utility software. Examples include anti-virus or disk defragmentation software.

##### ERP (enterprise resource planning) manages all a company's operations that involve information and resources through an integrated computer system. It allows a company to work and exist under one centralized database. It eliminates multiple entries of data that can lead to duplications or errors in data. It works in real time and that information is readily available to the entire company. An example of an ERP software is SAP where it can track manufacturing, inventory and service delivery.

##### Virtualization is the process of creating software or virtual representation of something, such as applications, network, server, etc. It's software that partitioned a computer system to run several operating systems on the same computer. It is a way for IT to reduce expenses while businesses get an increase in agility and efficiency. The difference between virtualization and cloud computing is virtualization is a software that manipulates hardware and cloud technology is a service that benefits from the manipulation. Cloud computing is a shared computing resource (software or data) on demand through the internet.

### Virtualization

##### i. Virtualization solved 2 problems. One it allow companies to partition their servers and run legacy apps on multiple operating systems using different types and versions. Servers started to reduce its costs in purchase, setup and maintenance. Second it helped reduce vendor lock in and became the foundation for cloud computing.

##### ii. Hypervisor software was developed decades ago to allow multiple users access at the same time to computers that performed batch processing. For example, payroll.

### Python

##### It is a term that is used in programming and algoythms based on fields. So it has the normal conventions of programming language but it is intended to be read by humans not machines.

##### Interpreted language is source code that is not translated by the target machine. A different program interpreter reads and execute the code. It is translated line by line and the command is executed. Python uses this language. Compiled language is target machine directly translates the code but the code must be rebuilt everytime there is a revision.

### Career Exploration

#### College Central

##### I have learned that this a much more fluid search than Indeed. Even though some of the posting are on the Indeed website, there was a difference in the number of jobs. Also the keywords needs to be precise so as to get the best result. I am actually looking for a virtual job and the central network has shown I need to gain more job experience.

#### Certficates

##### CompTIA is a cybersecurity certificate. I am not interested in this field of study.

##### Cisco has a website that is helpful when it comes to letting a person know how to stay on track with their studies and certifications. 

##### CISSP is another cybersecurity website. I do like that they list the different areas of occupations one can choose from and the level of expertise that is required.
