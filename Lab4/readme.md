### Executive Summary

##### This chapter will provide an overview of examining the operating systems and how the command line works. Exploring software through the use of interactive programming, graphics and diagram enviroment. Graphics rendering, compression and design are tools for student interested in web design.


### Python IDLE

##### The interactive shell runs Python instructions one at a time and shows your results immediately. The file editor lets you enter Python code for complete programs.

### Code Examples

##### i.  A variable is like a box that can store a single value within an assignment statement. It evalulates to the value it contains. For example, spam = 42 means when you type spam in the interactive shell the value 42 appears. The names spam, bacon and eggs are names that are used in Python tutorials because of the spam comedy sketch from Monty Python.
##### ii. An assignment statement is assigning a value to a variable. For example, spam = 'Goodbye' span = ' World' "Goodbye World'
##### iii. A function is like mini-pograms in your program. They contain code that does various things and reads its name followed by parentheses with values placed inside the parentheses, For example, print ('Hello world!')
##### iv. Three data types include integer [int()] is a whole number that can be positve, negative or hold a zero, string [str()] is a swquence of characters (text) inside double or single quotes; and float() represents real numbers that include decimal points. For example: integer int(str_a) + b; string str_a = '20.65'; float float(str_a) + b

### Graphics

#### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
##### A raster image is made up of thousands even millions of tiny little pixels. When you enlarge the image it appears blurred and low quality. Photos are in raster and scanned at 300dpi to maintain high quality. A vector image has no pixels and can be enlarged without losing quality. Fonts and objects(squares, circles) are saved as a vector file.

#### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression

##### Lossless compression reduces a file's size with no loss of quality after its been uncompressed and the file size remains the same as the original.  Lossy compression reduces the file size by removing some of the details and colors, creating a reduced file size. A designer has to determine the file size needed for his/her web design.

#### File Formats

##### JPEG, GIF and PNG are all image formats that's where they are similiar. Differences start with only GIF and PNG are good with line art. GIF format is used in animation. JPEG and PNG are great with photos but PNG high contrast and JPEG low contrast. 

#### File Properties

##### i. This design is related to the Affiliate Marketing business I am training for. I want to create a relatable image for consumers who trust what they see. It took seven layers to create this logo.

##### ii. The file size is 355,420 bytes and the default application is Adobe Illustrator CS6. A few browsers will also open the file such as Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.

### Conclusion

##### In this module the student learned the inner workings of the operating system, Python IDLE and new programming language. Along with learning the graphics and its components, students learned how to apply it other areas of the IT industry. At the end of the chapter, programming and graphic files that will highlight their work for potential employers.
