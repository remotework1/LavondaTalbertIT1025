### Executive Summary

#####


### Python IDLE

##### The interactive shell runs Python instructions one at a time and shows your results immediately. The file editor lets you enter Python code for complete programs.

### Code Examples

##### i.  A variable is like a box that can store a single value within an assignment statement. It evalulates to the value it contains. For example, spam = 42 means when you type spam in the interactive shell the value 42 appears. The names spam, bacon and eggs are names that are used in Python tutorials because of the spam comedy sketch from Monty Python.
##### ii. An assignment statement is assigning a value to a variable. For example, spam = 'Goodbye' span = ' World' "Goodbye World'
##### iii. A function is like mini-pograms in your program. They contain code that does various things and reads its name followed by parentheses with values placed inside the parentheses, For example, print ('Hello world!')
##### iv. Three data types include integer [int()] is a whole number that can be positve, negative or hold a zero, string [str()] is a swquence of characters (text) inside double or single quotes; and float() represents real numbers that include decimal points. For example: integer int(str_a) + b; string str_a = '20.65'; float float(str_a) + b

### Graphics

#### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
##### A raster image is made up of thousands even millions of tiny little pixels. When you enlarge yhimae it appears blurred and low quality. Photos are in raster and scanned at 300dpi to maintain high quality. A vector image has no pixels and can be enlarged without losing quality. Type and objects are for the most part saved as a vector file.
