### Executive Summary

##### In this module the students will learn the NSA in networking security and its components: networking and topologies. 

### Lucidchart

##### It was easy to follow when I viewed the teacher's example. The resource the teacher provided was helpful but I needed to review some Youtube video to explain areas I didn't quite understand like the wording. I used Visio in the past and enjoyed it. I am going to go through an entire tutorial to learn the program efficiently. 

### Introduction to Networking

#### Data Transmission

##### Packet (2) is a unit of data. It is the data that is used to transmit over the Internet. A device sends a message to another device breaks down the data into smaller pieces.

##### Packet-Sitching



### Cybersecurity and Encryption

#### Information Systems Security

##### a. Confidetiality will allow me to make sure the customers' personal information is restricted so noone else has access besides the chat and the customer. Integrity is insured by the customer providing personal information that matches what is on the Amazon database. Comparing the information determines if the person on the chat line is authentic. Availability is a 24-7 operation at Amazon. So as long as the customer access the chat line and provides the correct information then their problems will have a better chance of being resolved.

##### b. Three ways for authentication is soemthing they are (fingerprint), something they have(key or card) and or something they know (ID/password). Multi-factor authentication is done by combing two or more listed above. An RSA device which includes a PIN and a code from the RSA device.

##### c. ACL  or access control list is a list of users who have the ability to take specific actions. It is good that if something goes wrong you can find out which users were responsible. The disadvantage is if the users and resources increase it becomes harder to maintain. RBAC assign users to roles and then the users have access. It also allows the adminstrators to manage users and roles separately and help improves security. The disadvantage the user must have an in-depth knowledge of the impelenmentation and it's not business-friendly.

##### d. In a public key encryption you obtain it, encode the message and send it. The private key is necessar to crypt something that is sent with the public key.

##### e. Public key cryptography is the key that encrypt the information is different from the key that decrypt.

#### Cryptography
