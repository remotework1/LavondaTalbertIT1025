### Executive Summary

##### In this module the students will learn the NSA in networking security and its components: networking and topologies. 

### Lucidchart

##### It was easy to follow when I viewed the teacher's example. The resource the teacher provided was helpful but I needed to review some Youtube video to explain areas I didn't quite understand like the wording. I used Visio in the past and enjoyed it. I am going to go through an entire tutorial to learn the program efficiently. 

### Introduction to Networking

#### Data Transmission

##### Packet (2) is a unit of data. It is the data that is used to transmit over the Internet. A device sends a message to another device breaks down the data into smaller pieces.

##### Packet-Switching (4) is when technology allows a packet from one device to pass from one router to another across the internet until it reaches its destination. It can leave the same packet and travel differently and the receiving device will put in proper order.

##### IP Address (3) is an unique identifying number. Now that the internet has grown the IPv4 addresses will be exhausted. The IPv6 standard hs formatted at eight groups with an extended database to accomodate the internet growth.

##### DNS (5) is the Internet directory. It returns the IP address of the device requested to route properly.

##### Protocol (1) is two or more devices to exchange information over the network back and forth.

#### Network Hardware

##### a. A switch is intelligent and can actually learned the addresses of devices connected to it and send information to specific ports since the bandwidth doesn't have to be shared. The hub isn't smart and connects all of your network devices and the bandwidth has to be shared that slows down the network.

##### b. The router connect networks while hubs and switches create networks.

#### Network Topologies

##### a. Single point of failure is when a a part of the system fails it will stop the entire system from working.

##### b. Infrastructure Topology uses a combination of wireless and wired devices. Wireless mesh interconnected with each other wirelessly. Wireless mesh is more beneficial and economical by wirelessly connecting enire cities using existing technology.

#### Network Design

##### I created a network diagram featuring A Wireless Topology. I just wanted to show what I am using today in my home. I don't have a switch, just a cable line. It is possible that the cable line acts like a switch. Considering it is running into my house specically and tied to only my address.

#### NSA/CSS

##### The NSA role in U.S. cybersecurity includes Advisories and Technical Guidance, Threats Intelligence & Assessments, Products & Services, Education, Careers, Public Engagements and Partnerships with allies and Industries.

### Cybersecurity and Encryption

#### Information Systems Security

##### a. Confidetiality will allow me to make sure the customers' personal information is restricted so noone else has access besides the chat and the customer. Integrity is insured by the customer providing personal information that matches what is on the Amazon database. Comparing the information determines if the person on the chat line is authentic. Availability is a 24-7 operation at Amazon. So as long as the customer access the chat line and provides the correct information then their problems will have a better chance of being resolved.

##### b. Three ways for authentication is soemthing they are (fingerprint), something they have(key or card) and or something they know (ID/password). Multi-factor authentication is done by combing two or more listed above. An RSA device which includes a PIN and a code from the RSA device.

##### c. ACL  or access control list is a list of users who have the ability to take specific actions. It is good that if something goes wrong you can find out which users were responsible. The disadvantage is if the users and resources increase it becomes harder to maintain. RBAC assign users to roles and then the users have access. It also allows the adminstrators to manage users and roles separately and help improves security. The disadvantage the user must have an in-depth knowledge of the impelenmentation and it's not business-friendly.

##### d. In a public key encryption you obtain it, encode the message and send it. The private key is necessar to crypt something that is sent with the public key.

##### e. Public key cryptography is the key that encrypt the information is different from the key that decrypt.

#### Cryptography

##### a. Complete.

##### b. Message: what time is it. I tried to encrypt the message and turned the dial and it made no sense to me.

##### c. I notice that there wasn't so much a change in languages as it was how many times a letter was being duplicated. In both English and Spanish, I used the letter 'M' several times and got the same results.

##### d. It is any cipher that uses multiple substitution alphabets. It creates a lighter fingerprint than the Caesar cipher by flattening this distribution of letter frequencies. The secret message appeared eight blue bars. When I decrypt the word 'what' there was shift that occurred nine times. When I encrypt the word 'what', the shift was six times.

#### Brute-Force

##### A brute-force tries every decryption key for a cipher. Because it so effective, Caesar cipher shouldn't be used to encrypt secret information. Kerckhoffs' principle also believes that you shouldn't publish everything about your system, except the key. The principle also believes that your system is secure even if it's published.

### Conclusion
