### Executive Summary

##### This module explores the various protocols that support internet communication. Learning and describing all of the methodologies and creating exercises to support each theory. Designing and programming web pages from past to present along with a few common elements.

#### Internet Architecture

##### Internet Protocol

##### IP address stands for Internet Protocol address. They are the numbers assigned to computer network interfaces. IPv4 has over four billion unique IP addresses where IPv6 has 340 undecillion addresses and develop to increase the number of IP addresses.

##### ICANN (Internet Committee for Assigned Names and Numbers) is a nonprofit organization that oversees the use of internet domains. Globally the organization manage and oversee the domain name registration process and the assignment of IP addresses to Internet Service Providers.

#### TCP/IP

##### TCP/IP responsibility is the define the details of how data is sent and recieved through network adapters, switches, routers, hubs and other network communication hardware.

##### The client-server model in relation to TCP/IP works in a two part definition. The client is the computer or device that actually dials the phone while the server is the computer that listens then accepts or rejects the call that comes in.

##### i. Post office with protocol stacks: The layers are important to changing technology because it can change without afecting the other layers just by splitting the tasks. 

##### ii. The application layers includes HTTP, FTP, POP3, SMTP, SNMP.

#### Internet Security

##### HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) as of today, is the most widely used protocol in the world. It is used for viewing web pages (clear text). It supports the client-server model by providing a connection which results in a request and response.

##### HTTP is secured by the protocol named HTTPS (Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol) encrypted text.  It is HTTP with a security feature that encrypts the data that is being retrieved by HTTP. The data uses encryption algorithms to scramble while being transferred.

#### Securing Your Web Browser

##### Browser security is vital to controlling spyware being installed without one's knowledge to stopping intruders from taking control of your computer. Browsers are not setup in a secure default configuration.

##### A risk that is a result of a brower not being secure is cookies. They are place by specific websites we visit. The website collects unique identity of a visitor that can be an invasion of privacy. When authentication is asked, an attacher could acquire unauthorized access that site. Persistent cookies (stay on computer til it expires) are more dangerous than session cookies (clears when browser closes). 

### Internet Programming

#### World Wide Web Consortium

##### Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the World Wide Web. The W3C organization was create to try to improve the quality and standard of the world wide web.

##### Web Design and Applications invlove the abilities to convey vital information on pages that are accessible to all visitors. With the vast information of products, services and information, all 'WebApps' should not only be design for computers (large screen) but mobile devices (small screen) as well. The design layout and links should be transparent on both.

#### HTML5 and CSS

##### HTML5 create the basic element of webpages so other more advanced web coding can manipulate those basic elements. CSS purpose dexcribes how HTML elements are displayed on paper, screen or other media.  When building the web page, it made more sense to use HTML first because is is a basic code and interject CSS. This process was an easy way to remember the order of the coding. It helped to code in Tryit Editor because of the run button effect immediately.

#### HTML and XML

##### XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a markup language, self-descriptive and store and transport data. It doesn't do anything but carry data (what it is). HTML designed to display data (looks). 

### Components of a URL

##### scheme - tells your browser type of address so it connects correctly (http://)
##### domain - each segment of the domain name separated by a period (www.amazon.com)
##### top level domain - the domain located on the right (com)
##### default page - it is the page that displays when you don't specify a path and enter only a doman name. (www.amazon.com)
##### parameters - string of characters after the path begins with a question mark (?category=/electronics&r) 
##### anchor - begins with a hashtag and tells the browser to scoll to or load a specific part of the page (#Music)

### Conclusion

##### Designing and programming web pages with elements that is applicable to all users of the internet. Learning and defining internet terminology along with the protocols to ensure the methods and practices are easy to apply and understand. Knowing the difference between IP addresses, security and the function of the world wide web. Submitting exercises to be used for both the classroom and future references.
