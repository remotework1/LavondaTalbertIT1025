### Executive Summary

#### File Compression

##### a. The purpose of file compression are zipped files that take up less storage space and can transfer quickly to other computers. A zip file is a way of grouping or archving one or more files so they act as one smaller file.

##### b. SVGGrapic uncompressed file is 356 KB. SVGGraphic compressed file is 149 KB. A svg file is a vector base file which means that it is flat and doesn't have pixels like a jpeg files which supports photos. You can scale a SVG file to larger than its sizeThe compression of a jpeg file is 10:1 in its original state and keeps its image quality. It doesn't need compression.

### Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

##### i. The shark class methods are functions that are indented under the words class shark. These two functions are one for swimming and one for being awesome. The argument to these 2 functions is the word self that reference the objects in this class.

##### ii. A constructor's purpose is to initiate data. It runs as soon as an object of a class is formed by a computer process.

##### iii. A class is like a blueprint or prototype that can be defined are used to create objects. An object is an instance of a class. To instantiate an object means to give it a name and locating it into some physical space. I am still a bit unclear on the definition of instantiated.

### Unified Modeling Language (UML)

##### i. OMG (Object Management Group) is an international, open membership, not-for-profit technology standards consortium. It oversees the definition and maintenance of UML specifications. The purpose of UML is to provide tools for analysis, design, and implementtion of software-based systems as well as for modeling business and similar processes.

##### ii. object = shark; class = definition of a shark; abstraction = Sammy  ; encapsulation = a specific type of shark ; inheritance = swim(self). I matched these terms not really being sure if I understand the shark program. I tried to write the program several times and not successfully. 

#### 2. I have no concept on how to create a class diagram of the shark class. I would need to see an example of a class diagram to understand how to format it.
