### Career Exploration

##### I learned by reading the Occupational Outlook Handbook, Web Developers make a livable wase and have great job outlook. There are a couple of valuable pieces of information I am looking for and this particular field of study meets the requirements. One, the ability to work remote and two the job outlook growth an average of 13%.

#### College Central

##### It appears for the course of study I am learning, I will still need some years of experience to qualifty for an intern. I ay have to adjust my course of action and study a different avenue of IT like networking to stand a better chance of employment. The problem I have is Amazon sponsors my studies and I have to re-apply to announce a different area of IT and wait for approval. This is no reflection on the College Central Network, it is a valuable site.

#### Certifications

##### CompTIA is in relation to cybersecurity analysis which I have no interest in. It appears to work in relation to behavioral analytics to network and devices to prevent threats. It is interesting but no interest.

##### Cisco certification provides a variety of career certifications that appeals to me. The Cisco DevNet training and certification program is one that interests me. IoT (Internet of Things) have some relations but it appears IoT is far more data intensive which is something I do as a market researcher. This is a certification I will study more and make an attempt to acquire.

##### CISSP certification is for a system security profession. I am not interested in cybersecurity.

### Executive Summary

##### I chose Option 2. IT Programming and Development is my topic of interest but learning about CISCO in Unit 3 peaked my interest as well. The IT Programming and Development is one of the areas of computing Amazon has agreed to pay for. I want to have the opportunity to work one job (remote). This area of computing has remote jobs and an outlet of agencies to help in recruiting (Flexjobs.com, Bucketlist.org, Indeed.com). 

### Project

#### Research

##### 1. There are four areas of Programming and Development: Application, System, Game and Web Programmers. The decision to pick the one that has the highest percentage of remote jobs is important. I also learned in this research that a Developer is a different role than Programmer. Developer is good at one language and a Programmer is good at several different languages. Knowing that will be the difference in the amount of remote jobs available or having to work in-house.

### Conclusion

##### This class has introduced me to a large database of technical terminology. I am a print designer by trade and I thought it would have been more about design, colors, fonts and layouts. It was a fast introduction into the world of computer technology. The one thing I appreciate is making me focus on what I really want out of this degree. I know that working remote and finding a IT job that will allow that is the goal. Amazon says it will help aid their workers in finding a career that isn't tied to staying with them after the study is complete. This last part of the project really defined what is my end goal, Web Development.
