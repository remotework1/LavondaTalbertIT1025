### Career Exploration

#### College Central

##### It appears for the course of study I am learning, I will still need some years of experience to qualifty for an intern. I ay have to adjust my course of action and study a different avenue of IT like networking to stand a better chance of employment. The problem I have is Amazon sponsors my studies and I have to re-apply to announce a different area of IT and wait for approval. This is no reflection on the College Central Network, it is a valuable site.
